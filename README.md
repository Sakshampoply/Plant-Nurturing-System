# Plant-Nurturing-System

Introduction:

The aim of this project is to design and build an automated plant watering system using an Arduino Uno board. The device will use a soil moisture sensor to detect when the soil is dry and activate a water pump to water the plants. The project will involve building the circuit, programming the Arduino board, and testing the device to see how well it works.

Materials:

Arduino Uno board
Soil moisture sensor
Water pump
Relay module
Power supply
Tube
Jumper wires

Circuit Design:

The circuit design involves connecting the soil moisture sensor, water pump, and relay module to the Arduino Uno board using jumper wires. The soil moisture sensor will be connected to one of the analog input pins, and the relay module will be connected to one of the digital output pins. The water pump will be powered by a separate power supply and connected to the relay module using wires.

Programming:

The Arduino board will need to be programmed to read the moisture level of the soil and activate the water pump when the soil is too dry. The programming language used for this project is Arduino IDE, and the code will involve using the analog input pins to read the sensor values and implementing logic to control the relay module and water pump.

Testing:

Once the circuit is built and the code is written, the device can be tested by monitoring the moisture level of the soil and observing whether the water pump is activated when the soil is too dry. It is important to calibrate the sensor and adjust the code to ensure that the device is watering the plants correctly.

Conclusion:

Overall, this project demonstrates how an Arduino Uno board can be used to create an automated plant watering system using a soil moisture sensor and a water pump. The device can be a useful tool for those who want to keep their plants healthy and hydrated, especially when they are away from home for extended periods.
